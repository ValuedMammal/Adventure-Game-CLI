## Elements & Synopsis

Some of the coding techniques include:

- functions
- loops

You're part of a human space colony on an interstellar journey to the planet Sicily, however you must lead a rebellion against a feudal elite who stand to jeopardize the mission.

At one point the story branches, leading to two alternate endings, so completion is rewarded.
